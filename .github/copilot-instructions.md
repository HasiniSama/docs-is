We are writing the documents for,
- Developers – Integrating the product, need examples and clear config steps.
- Testers/QA – Verifying workflows, often need quick references.
- Support Engineers / Admins – Solving problems, need troubleshooting and clarity.
- Newcomers – Just getting started, need onboarding and context.

We assume that user only has the basic knowledge of,
- Programming
- Authentication
- What API means

Content should be always written assuming that the user has no prior knowledge of other concepts.

We follow below instructions in our documentation:
- Make the document scannable
    - Aim for short, simple sentences. (Maximum 20-25 words)
    - Bold key terms or phrases.
    - Leave enough white space (line breaks between paragraphs, sections and list items.)
    - Keep your content succinct. Nothing more, nothing less.
    - Have smaller paragraphs with logical separation.
    - Avoid inline lists. Use bullet points whenever necessary.
- Improving task-based documentation
    - Explain how to implement it step by step. What you see first, comes first.
    - Explain the WHY of each task. Your readers are engineers. They will not blindly follow you.
    - Use CLEAR, PLAIN, ACTION-FIRST writing
- Sentence-case titles
- Avoid passive voice
- Avoid is, are, be, being, was, were
- Avoid weasel words
