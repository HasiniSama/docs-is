## Data centers

Asgardeo uses two regional data centers to store data:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>
            Country
        </th>
        <th>
            Regional Data center
        </th>
        <th>
            Location
        </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            United States (US)
        </td>
        <td>
            East US
        </td>
        <td>
            Virginia
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            Europe (EU)
        </td>
        <td>
            Northern Europe

        <td>
            Ireland
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can onboard to Asgardeo in your preferred region by using the relevant URL (listed below). Your data will be stored in the corresponding regional data center.

- **Asgardeo Console - US region**: https://console.asgardeo.io/
- **Asgardeo Console - EU region**: https://console.eu.asgardeo.io/

Effective June 27, 2025, all applicable user and service-related data are stored in the selected regional data center (US or EU), replacing the previous approach of storing some data types only in the US.

### Subscription data

Your subscription account is the user account that's created when you are onboarded to Asgardeo. Billing details are linked to this account. Listed below are some of the subscription data:

- Billing email
- Subscription ID
- Tier details

!!! note "Update"

    Effective June 27, 2025, subscription data is stored in the regional data center (US or EU) selected during onboarding, replacing the previous approach of storing it exclusively in the US.

### Administrator data

Users onboarded to Asgardeo as [organization administrators]({{base_path}}/guides/users/manage-administrators/) are granted access to the global WSO2 services such as billing and support. Therefore, the administrator data (including profile information and login information from the billing/support portals) was previously stored exclusively in the US datacenter.

The profile information of organization administrators includes all the data that organization administrators enter in their user profiles.

!!! note "Update"

    Effective June 27, 2025, administrator data is stored in the selected regional data center (US or EU), replacing the previous approach of storing it exclusively in the US.

### End-user data

Data of your end users are only stored in the regional datacenter you selected when onboarding to Asgardeo.

## Data sharing

Some of your data, such as logs, will be accessible outside your selected region to ensure that WSO2's global entities (currently includes the USA, Sri Lanka, and Brazil) can provide technical support and other services. For example, technical support teams outside the region will need access to this data for various support and troubleshooting purposes. However, this data is stored only in the regional
datacenter that you have selected.

Therefore, note that your organizationâ€“level logs may include personal information (such as the IP addresses and email addresses) of your end users.
